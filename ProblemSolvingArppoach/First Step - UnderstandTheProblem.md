First, start by asking these questions:
1- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs ? (Do you have enough information to solve the problem?)
5- How should I be label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
